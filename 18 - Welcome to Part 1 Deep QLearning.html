<p>Welcome to Part 1!</p><p>In this part we are going get started into the World of AI and build our own self driving car. This is going to be a modelled version of a car (so it won't be driving on the streets of real cities) but still - it will learn how to drive itself. And the key word here is <em>learn, </em>because the car will not be given any rules on how to operate in the environment before hand - it will have to figure everything out on it's own. And to achieve that we will be using Deep Q-Learning.</p><p>Deep Q-Learning is the result of combining Q-Learning with an Artificial Neural Network. The states of the environment are encoded by a vector which is passed as input into the Neural Network. Then the Neural Network will try to predict which action should be played, by returning as outputs a Q-value for each of the possible actions. Eventually, the best action to play is chosen by either taking the one that has the highest Q-value, or by overlaying a Softmax function. </p><p>In this first Part, we will implement a Deep Q-Learning model to build an AI for a Self Driving Car. </p><p>See you inside!</p><p>Kirill &amp; Hadelin</p>
