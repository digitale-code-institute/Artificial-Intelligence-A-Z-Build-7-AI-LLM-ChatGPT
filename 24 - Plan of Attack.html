<p>Welcome to the Practical Activity&nbsp;of&nbsp;Part&nbsp;1!</p><p><br></p><p>In this Module&nbsp;we are going to build&nbsp;a Self Driving Car... from scratch !</p><ol><li><p>First, we will&nbsp;build the environment containing the map, the car and all the features that go with it.</p></li><li><p>Then, we will build the AI, which will be the Deep Q-Learning model.</p></li><li><p>And eventually, we will have our exciting demo.</p></li></ol><p><br></p><p><strong>HIGHLY&nbsp;VALUABLE BONUS! (DON'T MISS&nbsp;THAT):</strong> I thought it would be helpful for you to have the detailed explanations of the self-driving car implementation in TEXT, so I am giving you the chapter of my book on AI (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Crash-Course-hands-introduction-reinforcement-ebook/dp/B07Z9DC228" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">link here</a>) that explains in an even better way (because it's written) everything that will be explained in this new section:</p><p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tuqZVDI7hLM5jHx8se2AB26G0qIXZ3WgKPw293D7IcI/edit?usp=sharing" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tuqZVDI7hLM5jHx8se2AB26G0qIXZ3WgKPw293D7IcI/edit?usp=sharing</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Also, please make sure to install all the packages required for our implementation. In my book's chapter given just above you'll find very detailed installation instructions in pages 40 to 46.</strong></p><p><strong>And if you don't want to read the whole chapter and are just fine with the following video tutorials of this section, then please find below some simple installation instructions:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Linux and Max users, please open your terminal.<br>On Mac, the easiest way to open it is to press anywhere cmd + space, and then in the Spotlight Search you enter "terminal".<br>On Linux, you will find it very easily, usually on the left side of your monitor.<br>Then inside the terminal, copy paste and enter each of the following line commands separately:</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">conda install pytorch==0.3.1 -c pytorch
conda install -c conda-forge kivy</pre></li><li><p>And Windows users, please open the anaconda prompt, which you can find this way:<br>Windows Button in the lower left corner -&gt; List of programs -&gt; anaconda -&gt; anaconda prompt<br>Then inside the anaconda prompt, copy paste and enter each of the following line commands separately:</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">conda install -c peterjc123 pytorch-cpu
conda install -c conda-forge kivy</pre></li></ul><p>Enjoy&nbsp;AI!</p><p>Hadelin</p>
