<p>Welcome to Part 2!</p><p>In this Part we will build a more advanced AI model called Deep Convolutional Q-Learning. It simply consists of adding to Deep Q-Learning a Convolutional Neural Network (see the Annex at the end of this course) so that our AI can see images, which will be the inputs of the whole Neural Network.</p><p>Once we build the Neural Network, thus composed of first a Convolutional Neural Network, followed by a fully-connected Neural Network, we will train it with the Deep Q-Learning model to play Doom, this famous game where you have to reach a destination without getting killed by monsters.</p><p>See you inside!</p><p>Kirill &amp;Â Hadelin</p>
