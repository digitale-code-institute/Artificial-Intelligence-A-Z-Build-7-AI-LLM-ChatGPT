<p>Welcome to Part 3!</p><p>Now that we built an AI that has a brain (Deep Q-Learning) and that can see (Deep Convolutional Q-Learning), we will add to it a memory and a critic sense (LSTM-A3C). This model is fascinating because it is taking us closer to the human brain. Besides, it is one of the most powerful models in the AI ecosystem.</p><p>Once we build the full brain at the core of the A3C model, we will train our AI to play Breakout.</p><p>See you inside!</p><p>Kirill &amp;Â Hadelin</p>
