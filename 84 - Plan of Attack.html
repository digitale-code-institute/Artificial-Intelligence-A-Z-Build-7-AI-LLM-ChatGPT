<p>Welcome to the Practical Activity of Part 3!</p><p>This time we are going to build an AI to beat the game of Breakout! Here is the plan:</p><ol><li><p>First, we will build an AI, which will be the LSTM-A3C model.</p></li><li><p>Then, we will watch some very cool videos of our AI playing Breakout and trying to beat it!</p></li></ol><p>We will build this AI with PyTorch, a highly advanced Deep Learning &amp; AI platform. Every single line of code will be explained in details but I would recommend to have a first look at the PyTorch documentation to start getting familiar with PyTorch:</p><p><a href="http://pytorch.org/docs/master/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">PyTorch Documentation Here</a></p><p><strong>Also, please make sure to install all the packages required for our implementation. Below are the Installation Instructions:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Linux and Max users, please open your terminal.<br>On Mac, the easiest way to open it is to press anywhere cmd + space, and then in the Spotlight Search you enter "terminal".<br>On Linux, you will find it very easily, usually on the left side of your monitor.<br>Then inside the terminal, copy paste and enter each of the following line commands separately:</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">conda install -c pytorch pytorch
conda install -c akode gym
conda install -c menpo ffmpeg
conda install -c conda-forge opencv</pre></li><li><p>And Windows users, please open the anaconda prompt, which you can find this way:<br>Windows Button in the lower left corner -&gt; List of programs -&gt; anaconda -&gt; anaconda prompt<br>Then inside the anaconda prompt, copy paste and enter each of the following line commands separately:</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">conda install -c pytorch pytorch
conda install -c akode gym
conda install -c menpo ffmpeg
conda install -c conda-forge opencv</pre></li></ul><p>Enjoy AI!</p>
